The Student Management System is a console-based application developed using Java and MySQL that allows educational institutions to efficiently manage student data. The system provides basic functionalities like adding, updating, and deleting student records, as well as tracking attendance, managing grades, and generating report cards.
The project helps automate routine tasks, reduce manual effort, and maintain accurate records of students. The backend is powered by MySQL, which ensures reliable data storage and retrieval, while Java handles the business logic and user interaction via the console.
